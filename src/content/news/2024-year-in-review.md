Astro is a web framework well-suited for content-driven websites. Its Islands Architecture allows you to combine static pages with dynamic elements, striking a balance between performance and interactivity. Beyond that, you can leverage SSR, middleware, and endpoints to build applications that run on the server side, too.

Recent updates have especially emphasized features for building dynamic sites, hinting at Astro’s evolution into a robust, full-stack framework. For a more detailed introduction to Astro, check out the official [Why Astro?](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) docs.

In this post, I’ll summarize what I see as the most significant happenings in the Astro ecosystem in 2024. I’ll also touch on what might be coming in 2025, as far as I’m aware.

If you’re interested, I’ve also published a [2023 edition (in Japanese)](https://zenn.dev/morinokami/articles/astro-2023-2024) of this article. Feel free to check it out for a look back at Astro’s progress in 2023.

## Project health indicators

### Release Versions

As of the start of 2024, Astro was at [v4.0.8](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%404.0.8), and by the time of writing this article near the end of the year, [v5.1.1](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%405.1.1) has been released. Including beta versions, **there were a total of 169 releases in 2024**. That’s almost on par with the number of releases in 2023, which was 175.

In 2023, the major version jumped from 1 to 4, giving the impression of a rapid pace of feature additions and improvements. In 2024, the major version only went from 4 to 5, and the pace of version bumps seems to have eased somewhat.

For those who are curious about the details of each release, you can check [the full list of Astro releases on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases).

### GitHub Stars

According to [GitHub Star History](https://star-history.com/#withastro/astro&Date), Astro’s GitHub stars were around 37,000 in early 2024 but increased to around 48,000 by the end of the year. Although that’s a bit slower than 2023’s increase of 15,000, it’s still a jump of over 10,000 for the year. It’s fair to say Astro’s star count is still on a healthy upward trend.
