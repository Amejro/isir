# Content collections

## Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

**Added in:** `astro@2.0.0`

**Content collections** are the best way to manage sets of content in any Astro project. Collections help to organize and query your documents, enable Intellisense and type checking in your editor, and provide automatic TypeScript type-safety for all of your content. Astro v5.0 introduced the Content Layer API for defining and querying content collections. This performant, scalable API provides built-in content loaders for your local collections. For remote content, you can use third-party and community-built loaders or create your own custom loader and pull in your data from any source.
